# work-day-planner


## Description

I made a day player to help you keep track of your day! You can type in your daily todo list in each time block and click save and it will keep your todo list save on your screen for you. There is live clock so you know what time of the day it currently is!  The time slot will appear red if the time slot matches the current time of the day. All time slots that have already happened will appear grey and all future time slots will appear green.
